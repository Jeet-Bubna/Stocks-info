    The NSE has done some shit which doesnt let webscraping happen easily
    So we just change the headers such that it doesnt show that we are doing
    It using a python script. Requests library like has one of its headers
    Blasting that it is a python script. The website just blocks ts ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
